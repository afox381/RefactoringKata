# Refactoring Kata

Provided is an initial implementation of a statement generator for a Movie rental business. It works, and meets all requirements, but its implementation is messy, and untested.

**The codebase should be refactored to improve its maintainability without modifying its behaviour. [characterisation tests](http://wiki.c2.com/?CharacterizationTest) should be used to verify defects have not been introduced while refactoring.**

### How do we rate the exercise?

Performance is based on:

* Clarity of code
* Showing that tests have enabled the refactoring, and don't break when the code has been refactored
* Prioritisation skills on what to refactor
* Critical thinking
* Adherence to S.O.L.I.D. principles
* Design Patterns used (or planning to use)
